## Hi there 👋

I'm Salvatore, in art MR.SICE. 
I'm a Digital Hybrid Artist and Creative Director.


I refuse to be boxed into a single discipline. My work flows between capturing reality through photography and constructing it through 3D environments. With AI as a new creative tool, I'm expanding into motion and video, offering businesses complete visual ecosystems rather than isolated deliverables.
