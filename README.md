## Hi there 👋

I'm Salvatore, in art ## MR.SICE. 

I'm a **Digital Hybrid Artist and Creative Director** that refuse to be boxed into a single discipline. 

I specialize in the physics of light, whether I’m capturing it through a camera lens or simulating it in a 3D engine.

With AI as a new creative tool, I blend traditional media with cutting-edge AI workflows, offering businesses a complete visual ecosystems rather than isolated deliverables.



Fun Facts : 

* **Logic:** `if (drink.isAlcoholic) { return false; }`
* **Energy Source:** Powered exclusively by [Coffee/Water], 0% alcohol required.
